# L-D_HOML

Use this space to write and practice code from Geron's Hands on machine learning. 

Goal: finish the book by EoY ?

Process: Read a chapter, write the code along with personal comments, and include the answers to each chapter's exercises in the original ipynb colab file. Rewrite the code in a local jupyter notebook and push it to the repo. 

TBD: where should we have discussions?
